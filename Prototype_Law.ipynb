عام، ويتكرر صرفها بمرور سنة على صرف أخر علاوة، وتحتسب أول علاوة بعد مرور عام على استلام العامل للعمل. وقد قرر المشرع في قانون العمل مبدأ عام حيث جعل العلاوة الدورية السنوية جزءاً من الأجر وتأخذ حكمه (المادة رقم 1 فقرة ج بند 3).\\n\\nوبهذا المعنى، تعتبر العلاوة الدورية السنوية زيادة سنوية تعطى للعامل زيادة على أجره الأصلي (أجر الالتحاق بالعمل). والعلاوة الدورية السنوية منشأها إرادة المشرع، وهي مقررة بمقتضى حكم المادة الثانية من مواد إصدار قانون العمل الصادر بالقانون رقم 12 لسنة 2003، وهى لا تقل عن 7% من الأ', 'بناءً على السياق المقدم، لا توجد إجابة متاحة. السياق يحتوي على مجموعة من

يمكن تقديم بعض المعلومات التي قد تكون ذات صلة، مثل أن قانون العمل المصري يشترط في العديد من العقود والعلاقات العمالية أن تكون مكتوبة وواضحة، وأن تتضمن جميع الشروط والأحكام اللازمة للتعاقد. كما يجب أن تكون العقود قانونية وغير ملغاة، وأن يتم إخطار العامل بتفاصيل العقد قبل بدء العمل.', 'لا توجد إجابة متاحة حسب السياق المقدم. السياق يتحدث عن سن تشغيل الأطفال قبل بلوغهم سن اتمام التعليم الأساسي أو

مواعيد الإجازة السنوية حسب مقتضيات العمل وظروفه، وأنه لا يجوز قطعها إلا لأسباب قوية تقتضيها مصلحة العمل. كما أنه يجب على العامل القيام بالاجازة في التاريخ وال期限 الذي حدده صاحب العمل، وإذا رفض العامل القيام بالاجازة كتابياً، فإن هذا يسقط حقه في مقابلها.\\n\\nإذا كنت تحتاج إلى معلومات أكثر حول حقوق صاحب العمل في هذا الشأن، فيجب أن تراجع قانون العمل أو اللوائح الداخلية للشركة بشكل مباشر.', 'بناءً

العامة حول الفصل التعسفي في قانون العمل المصري وفقاً لما هو متاح لدينا:\\n\\n### حالات الفصل التعسفي في قانون العمل المصري:\\nوفقًا للقانون رقم 12 لسنة 2003، هناك عدة حالات تسمح بفصل العامل تعسفياً، وهي:\\n\\n1. **عدم توفر الشروط اللازمة لاستمرار العقد**:\\n   - إذا لم يكن العقد قانونياً صالحاً، مثل عدم توفر الشروط اللازمة للعقد.\\n\\n2. **عدم احترام العامل لأوامر صاحب العمل**:\\n   - إذا ارتكب العامل جناية أو جنايات خطيرة ضد صاحب العمل أو أحد أفراد أسرته، أو إذا ارتكب العامل جناية أخرى خطيرة.\\n\\n3. **عدم القدرة على الاستمرار', 'بناءً على السياق المقدم، فإن ميعاد استحقاق العلاوة الدورية للعمال هو أول يناير من كل عام. \\n\\nفالنص يؤكد على أنه \"تحتسب أول علاوة بعد مرور عام على استلام العامل للعمل\". وهذا يعني أن العمال يبدأون في الاستحقاق للعلاوة الدورية بعد مرور سنة على استلامهم للعمل من قبل الشركة أو المنظمة التي يعملون فيها.\\n\\nكما ذكر السياق أيضًا أن هناك بعض الحالات الخاصة التي قد تؤثر على هذا الميعاد، مثل إذا تعرضت الشركة لأي ظروف اقتصادية صعبة قد تمنعها من صرف العلاوة. في هذه الحالة، يعرض الأمر إلى المجلس القومي للاجور لتقرير ما يراه مناسبًا في خلال ثلاثين يومًا.\\n\\nلذا، يمكن القول أن الميعاد الأساسي لاستحقاق العلاوة الدورية هو أول يناير من كل عام، ولكن في حالات خاصة قد يتأخر ذلك بناءً على القرار النهائي للجنة الوطنية للاجور.', 'وفقًا للسياق المقدم، لا توجد معلومات مباشرة حول الميعاد الخاص ببطلان أي مخالصة عن حق من حقوق العامل. السياق يتناول فقط

يكون أول يناير من كل عام ، ويتكرر صرفها بمرور سنة على صرف أخر علاوة ، وتحتسب أول علاوة بعد مرور عام على استلام العامل للعمل . وقد قرر المشرع في قانون العمل مبدأ عام ، حيث جعل العلاوة الدورية السنوية جزءاً من الأجر وتأخذ حكمه ( المادة رقم 1 فقرة ج بند 3 ) . وبهذا المعنى تعتبر العلاوة الدورية السنـوية زيادة سنـوية تعطى للعـامل زيـادة على أجره الأصلي ( أجر الالتحاق بالعمل ) . والعلاوة الدورية السنوية ، منشأها إرادة المشرع ، فهي مقررة بمقتضى حكم المادة الثانية من مواد إصدار قانون العمل الصادر بالقانون رقم 12 لسنه 2003 ، وهى لا تقل عن 7 % من الأجر الأساسي الذي تحسب على أساسه اشتراكات التأمينات الاجتماعية ( دون حد أدنى أو أقصى ) على خلاف ما كان مقرراً في قانون العمل السابق بمقتضى نص المادة 42 حين جعل المشرع حدها الأدنى جنيهان وحدها الأقصى سبعة جنيهات . ويلتزم أصحاب الأعمال – أيا كان عدد عمالهم – بصرف العلاوة الدورية السنوية في تاريخ استحقاقها ، وبنسبتها المقررة حسب التفصيل السابق و صدر الحكم التالي الذي جاء فيه للتاكيد علي ماسبق \" وأن قرار رئيس مجلس الإدارة لا يعدو أن يكون قراراً كاشفاً وصدوره في تاريخ متأخر عن ميعاد استحقاق العلاوة لا يهدر حق العاملين في استحقاقها بأثر رجعى من تاريخ مرور سنه ( من تاريخ استلام العامل للعمل أو مرور سنة على صرف أخر علاوة ) \" . و كذلك الحكم \" هذا ومن المستقر عليه فقها وقضاء أن استمرار صاحب العمل بصفة دورية ومنظمة في منح علاوات دورية بمقدار ثابت يولد لديهم اعتقاداً بالتزام صاحب العمل بالاستمرار في منحها لهم وبحقهم في اقتضائها كما لا يصح له تعليق صرف هذه العلاوة في أحدى السنوات على موافقة مجلس الإدارة ( نقض مدني 139 لسنه 37 ق 28/3/1982 ) .', 'ج: يشترط المشروع المصري في بعض العقود أن تكون مكتوبة وألا بطل التصرف مثل عقد الشركة وعقد تأجير الاستغلال وعقد العمل المشترك ( الاتفاقية الجماعية ) أما بالنسبة لعقد العمل لا يشترط فيه أي شكل خاص (مادة 677 مدني مصري) ما لم تنص القوانين واللوائح الإدارية على خلاف ذاك – وجاء المشرع المصري فى قانون العمل السابق 137 لسنه 1981 بمقتضى نص المادة 30 منه بقاعدة مؤداها أنه يجب أن يكون عقد العمل ثابتاً بالكتابة ومحرراً باللغة العربية وليس معنى ذلك أنه جعل عقد العمل شكلي أو اشترط الكتابة لانعقاده بدليل أنه في حالة العجز عن اثبات وجوده بالكتابة أجاز المشرع للعامل وحده إثبات حقوقه بكافة طرق الإثبات في حالة عدم وجود عقد مكتوب – ولعل المشرع في قانون العمل الجديد رقم 12 لسنه 2003 قد عدل من صياغة المادة المتفق مع الغاية فحاء نص المادة 32 منه على النحو التالي : يلتزم صاحب العمل بتحرير عقد العمل كتابة باللغة العربية من ثلاث نسخ 00 وإذا لم يوجد عقد مكتوب للعامل وحده إثبات حقوقه بكافة طرق الإثبات ومازالت الكتابة بهذا النص للإثبات وليست للانعقاد . غاية ما في الأمر أن المشرع جعل الكتابة التزام على صاحب العمل بحسبانه رب العمل المخاطب بأحكام شرط الإثبات بالكتابة حماية الجانب الضعيف وتجنيبه

فيحدد صاحب العمل مواعيد الإجازة السنوية حسب مقتضيات العمل وظروفه ولا يجوز قطعها إلا لأسباب قوية تقتضيها مصلحة العمل ، ويلتزم العامل بالقيام بالإجازة في التاريخ والمدة التى حددها صاحب العمل وإذا رفض العامل كتابتاً القيام بالإجازة سقط حقه في اقتضاء مقابلها ، وفي جميع الأحوال يجب أن يحصل العامل على إجازة سنوية مدتها خمسة عشر يوماً منها ستة أيام متصلة على الأقل ويلتزم صاحب العمل بتسوية رصيد الأجازات أو الأجر المقابل له كثلاث سنوات على الأكثر فإذا انتهت علاقة العمل قبل استنفاد العامل رصيد إجازته السنوية استحق الأجر المقابل لهذا الرصيد ، وللعامل طبقاً لأحكام المادة 49 الحق في تحديد موعد إجازته السنوية إذا كان متقدماً لأداء الامتحان في إحدى مراحل التعليم بشرط أن يخطر صاحب العمل قبل قيامه ب؟لإجازة بخمسة عشر يوماً على الأقل ، مما سبق يتضح أن المشرع في قانون العمل الجديد قد أبقى على حق صاحب العمل في تحديد مواعيد إجازة العامل وتجزئتها ولكن في حدود ما قرره من أحكام لمدة الإجازة وفقاً للأقدمية أو السن والقواعد المتعلقة بتجزئة الإجازة ، وأن يحصل العامل على إجازة سنوية مدتها خمسة عشر يوماً منها ستة أيام متصلة على الأقل تبعاً لمقتضيات العمل وظروفه ولا يقيده بذلك سوي : أولاً : منح العامل الحق في تحديد مدة موعد إجازته السنوية إذا كان متقدماً لأداء الامتحان . ثانياً : منح العامل الحق في تحديد مدة ستة أيام متصلة إجازة سنوية تبعاً لظروفه – فالعامل الذى يطلب إجازة سنوية للراحة والاستجمام وقضائها فى أحد المصايف فإن صاحب العمل يجب أن يجيبه إلى طلبه لأن لهذه الأسباب شرعت الإجازة السنوية ، ويجب على صاحب العمل ألا يتراخى في تحديد الفترة التى يمكن خلالها قيام العامل بالإجازة حتى لا يفوت على العامل فرصه الاستمتاع بها في هذا التوقيت . أما عن رفض العامل القيام بالإجازة كتابتاً فإن كان ذلك يسقط حقه في المقابل النقدي للإجازة فلا يسقط حقه في عين الحق وهو القيام بالإجازة فيما بعد . وكون صاحب العمل ملتزما بتسوية رصيد الأجازات أو الأجر المقابل له كل ثلاث سنوات فهذا يعنى أن التسوية يمكن عن طريق قيام العامل بالإجازة ( عين الحق ) أو حصوله على مقابل نقدي لها ( مقابل الحق ) مهما كان رصيدها – وإذا انتهت علاقة العمل استحق العامل الأجر المقابل لهذا الرصيد حتي ولو زاد عن ثلاثة أشهر . ولا يجوز للعامل أن يتراخى بإجازته ثم يطلب بالمقابل النقدي عنها وألا فقدت اعتبارها ولم تحقق الغرض منها واستحالت إلى عوض نقدي وفي ذلك مصادره على اعتبارات النظام العام الذي دعت إليها ومخالفاً لها أما إذا حل ميعاد الإجازة ورفض صاحب العمل الترخيص له بها فإنه يكون قد أخل بالتزام جوهري ولزمه تعويض العامل عنها ، ويقع على عائق صاحب العمل عبء إثبات أن العامل قد حصل على إجازة سنوية مدفوعة الأجر', 'وضع القانون رقم 12 لسنة 2003 \"قانون العمل الموحد\" في مصر ضوابط وشروط محددة لصاحب العمل إذا كان بصدد فصل عامل أو موظف لديه من العمل. حيث تنص المادة 69 من قانون العمل الموحد على أنه لا يجوز فصل العامل إلا إذا ارتكب خطأ جسيما، ويعتبر من قبيل الخطأ الجسيم الحالات الآتية: 1. إذا ثبت انتحال العامل لشخصية غير صحيحة أو قدم مستندات مزورة 2. إذا ثبت ارتكاب العامل لخطأ نشأت عنه أضرار جسيمة لصاحب العمل، بشرط أن يبلغ صاحب العمل الجهات المختصة بالحادث خلال أربع وعشرين ساعة من وقت علمه بوقوعه. 3. إذا تكرر من العامل عدم مراعاة التعليمات اللازم إتباعها لسلامة العمال والمنشأة – بشرط أن تكون هذه التعليمات مكتوبة ومعلنة في مكان ظاهر – رغم التنبيه عليه كتابة بمراعاة ذلك. 4. إذا تغيّب العامل بدون مبرر مشروع أكثر من عشرين يوما متقطعة خلال السنة الواحدة أو أكثر من عشرة أيام متتالية، على أن يسبق الفصل إنذار كتابي بخطاب موصى عليه بعلم الوصول من صاحب العمل للعامل بعد غيابه عشرة أيام في الحالة الأولى، وبعد غيابه خمسة أيام في الحالة الثانية. 5. إذا ثبت أن العامل أفشى أسرار المنشأة التي يعمل بها وأن هذا أدى إلى إحداث أضرار جسيمة بالمنشأة. 6. إذا قام العامل بمنافسة صاحب العمل في ذات نشاطه. 7. إذا وُجد العامل أثناء ساعات العمل في حالة سكر بيّن أو متأثرا بما تعاطاه من مادة مخدرة. 8. إذا ثبت اعتداء العامل على صاحب العمل أو المدير العام، وكذلك إذا وقع منه اعتداء جسيم على أحد رؤسائه أثناء العمل أو بسببه. 9. إذا لم يراع العامل الضوابط الواردة في المواد من (192) إلى (194) من الكتاب الرابع من قانون العمل (المتعلقة بمخالفة قواعد الإضراب عن العمل). وفي غير تلك الحالات التسع المذكورة أعلاه، لا يجوز لصاحب العمل أن يقوم بفصل العامل على الإطلاق، وإلا يعتبر ذلك الفصل فصلاً تعسفيا. فيما يتعلق بالإجراءات الواجب إتباعها في حالة الفصل التعسفي، فإنه تنص المادة 70 من قانون العمل الموحد على أنه إذا نشأ نزاع جاز لكل من العامل وصاحب العمل أن يطلب من الجهة الإدارية المختصة خلال سبعة أيام من تاريخ النزاع تسويته ودياً، فإذا لم تتم التسوية في موعد أقصاه عشرة أيام من تاريخ تقديم الطلب جاز لكل منهما اللجوء إلى اللجنة القضائية في موعد أقصاه خمسة وأربعون يوما من تاريخ النزاع وألا سقط حقه في عرض الأمر على اللجنة. كما تنص المادة 71 من قانون العمل الموحد على أنه تختص كل لجنة دون غيرها بالفصل في المنازعات الفردية الناشئة عن تطبيق أحكام هذا القانون، وتفصل اللجنة في النزاع المعروض عليها خلال ستين يوماً من تاريخ عرضه. وعلي اللجنة أن تفصل في طلب العامل خلال خمسة عشر يوما من تاريخ أول جلسة ويكون قرارها نهائيا، فإذا رفضت الطلب ألزمت صاحب العمل بإعادة العامل إلي عمله، وان يؤدي إليه ما لم يصرف له من مستحقات. فإذا لم يقم صاحب العمل بتنفيذ قرار اللجنة بإعادة العامل إلي عمله اعتبر ذلك فصلاً تعسفياً يستوجب التعويض طبقا للمادة (122) من هذا القانون. وعلي اللجنة أن تفصل في الموضوع بالتعويض المؤقت إذا طلب العامل ذلك. ويكون قرار اللجنة في هذه الحالة واجب النفاذ فوراً ولو طلب استئنافه. وتخصم المبالغ التي يكون العامل قد استوفاها تنفيذا لقرار اللجنة بوقف التنفيذ من مبلغ التعويض الذي قد يحكم له به أو من أية مبالغ أخرى مستحقه له لدي صاحب العمل. ووفقاً للمادة 68 فإنه يكون الاختصاص بتوقيع جزاء الفصل من الخدمة للجنة المشار إليها في المادة (71) ويكون توقيع باقي الجزاءات التأديبية لصاحب العمل أو من يفوضه لذلك. في حالة مخالفة صاحب العمل لحكم تلك المادة، فإنه يعاقب بغرامة لا تقل عن مائة جنيه ولا تجاوز خمسمائة جنيه. وتعدد الغرامة بتعدد العمال الذين وقعت في شأنهم الجريمة وتضاعف الغرامة في حالة العود، وذلك كما تقضي المادة 246 من قانون العمل.', 'يستحق العاملون الذين تسري في شأنهم أحكام القانون المرافق علاوة سنوية دورية في تاريخ استحقاقها لا تقل عن (7%) من الأجر الأساسي الذي تحسب علي أساسه اشتراكات التأمينات الاجتماعية ، وذلك حتى
